Salut ! 
I tried to do my best for case. 
I couldn't completed the design perfectly, cuz of time limit. But I guess other guys are fine at least i hope.
It is pretty responsive on my screen but I controlled when it shrunk there are some design problems.
It takes 2 hours deploy the project. I had some problems.
Here you can see the deployment project: https://darknithorynque.github.io/kaizen-project/
